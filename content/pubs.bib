    year = {2016},
    publisher = {JMLR.org},
    abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs - extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

    abstract = {Deep neural networks (NNs) are powerful black box predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.},

Thus, the final camera pose descriptor differences represent camera pose changes. In addition, we build a pose regressor that is trained with a geometric loss to infer finer relative poses between a query and nearest neighbour images. Experiments show that our method is able to generalise in a meaningful way, and outperforms related methods across several experiments.},

  abstract   = {We introduce an efficient camera relocalization approach which can be easily integrated into dense 3D reconstruction pipelines, such as KinectFusion. Our method is based on keyframes and makes use of randomized ferns which provide both compact encoding of frames and fast retrieval of pose proposals in case of tracking failure. During successful tracking, each frame/pose pair is considered as a potential keyframe. Only frames which are sufficiently dissimilar in the space of appearance are added to the set of keyframes. This keeps the scene representation compact and at the same time the coverage sufficiently dense. Frame dissimilarity is defined via the block-wise hamming distance (BlockHD) between the codes generated by the ferns. Distances between incoming frames and keyframes are efficiently and simultaneously evaluated by simply traversing the nodes of the ferns and counting co-occurrences with keyframes having equal sub-codes. For tracking recovery, camera pose proposals are retrieved from keyframes with smallest BlockHDs which are then used to reinitialize the tracking algorithm.

Both, online determination of keyframes and camera pose recovery are computationally efficient and have minimal impact on the run-time of the 3D reconstruction. Incorporating our method allows seamless continuation of reconstructions even when tracking is frequently lost. Additionally, we demonstrate how marker-free augmented reality can be realized by mesh-to-volume registration between an offline model and the online reconstruction. Our relocalization method is particularly appealing in such AR applications where the experience of steady pose tracking is essential.},

  abstract   = {We address the problem of inferring the pose of an RGB-D camera relative to a known 3D scene, given only a single acquired image. Our approach employs a regression forest that is capable of inferring an estimate of each pixel's correspondence to 3D points in the scene's world coordinate frame. The forest uses only simple depth and RGB pixel comparison features, and does not require the computation of feature descriptors. The forest is trained to be capable of predicting correspondences at any pixel, so no interest point detectors are required. The camera pose is inferred using a robust optimization scheme. This starts with an initial set of hypothesized camera poses, constructed by applying the forest at a small fraction of image pixels. Preemptive RANSAC then iterates sampling more pixels at which to evaluate the forest, counting inliers, and refining the hypothesized poses. We evaluate on several varied scenes captured with an RGB-D camera and observe that the proposed technique achieves highly accurate relocalization and substantially out-performs two state of the art baselines.},
